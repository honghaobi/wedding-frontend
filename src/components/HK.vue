          et’s rewind back to Apple Cup November 29th, 2013. Kelli in crimson and Henry in a purple UW jersey and a backwards cap. We were introduced
          by our mutual best friend Brooke at a tailgating party, drinking Rainier’s and playing cornhole. Henry was talking a lot of shit and forcing
          peeps to take shots. Aaaandddd the Cougs took a big L. Looking back, it’s a day to remember, because it was the day our friendship started
          despite the rivalry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the next 2 years our friendship grew stronger. We got to know each other over concerts, group hangs, and deep conversations about life
          over tacos. We will both tell you that there was an instant connection between us, and have always been drawn towards each other.

          ast forward to October of 2015. Henry made a massage appointment with Kelli because he "tweaked his back". But we all know he was using
          this as an excuse to holla at Kell. During the session, Henry asked if she wanted to come over for a fancy steak dinner . Kelli was taken
          aback and thought "Is he asking me out?!"
        </p>
        <p>
          He was.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the dinner date, we started hanging out almost every day. Both could see this being the real deal, *insert more corny phrases here*.
          Then the fairytale was put on hold. Henry had just gotten out of a long term relationship that summer and was a little hesitant to be off
          the market for good. We had deep conversation and decided that if he wasn’t ready, then we did not want this to ruin our friendship that we
          cherished. So at the end of the night, it was decided we would just stay friends. We were both bummed but thought it was the right choice.

          eanwhile, Kelli got on the dating app Bumble and started seeing another guy pretty quickly (he was no Henry though). We still talked as
          friends and after a number of weeks, Hen realized he made a mistake. How could he be such an idiot?! He asked Kell out for dinner to Din Tai
          Fung and told her he wanted to give it another go, because he knew it was something special. Over xiao long bao she told Henry she had
          unfortunately started dating someone else, but still had feelings for him. Henry would wait until she figured out what she wanted. Kelli
          took a few weeks to think about it, but couldn’t get Henry off her mind. On December 28th, she told Henry that he was the one for her. And
          that’s how Kell played her cards right and swooped Henry up right off the market. Sorry Ladies! It wasn’t a hard choice when we decided to
          move in together…2 months later. Some will say it’s too fast. We disagree. With learning how to live together early, it made our
          relationship stronger; but not without some trials and tribulations (Henry is very OCD if you don’t know, and it took Kell a while to figure
          out how to execute the “proper” folding technique so towels fit perfectly in the closet…you don’t want to see Henry upset about the
          towels!). But on the flip side, Kell has taught him how to let go of some of those tendencies and live in the moment. This is just one
          example of how we balance each other out. We are Yin and Yang, opposites yet in perfect balance. Together, we have always stood in unison on
          our beliefs, morals, values, and what is important in life. We continue to push and challenge each other to be the best versions of
          ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our three years together, we have been blessed to have so many wonderful memories and experiences with all of you wonderful humans. We’d
          love to share them all but here are some favorites and most influential. If you’re still reading…scroll down!

          e are both big family people, it’s the most important. So when we decided to introduce each other to the families it was a big deal. Kelli
          took Hen to the super classy Emerald Queen Casino with her whole family. 80 bucks was lost in the slot machines but we got for dinner
          vouchers to the Tatoosh Grill...ya win some ya lose some! It was there that Henry really got a chance to sit down and get to know everyone.
          Kell’s Dad, Mark started trash talking Henry’s NFL team the Bronco’s. The mini rivalry hasn’t stopped since. The McKeown family lost a bet
          to Henry and had to begrudgingly wear Broncos jerseys for a Hawks game. Henry has seamlessly fit into Kelli’s huge extended family. He
          recently cooked a 25-pound prime rib for Christmas dinner for her family and earned even more brownie points. Kelli met Henry’s family at
          his Grandma’s house and she learned about Kelli’s sweet tooth. Ever since, Grandma has never let Kell leave without some type of chocolate
          and her famously delicious dumplings for leftovers. We have frequent dinners at Grandma’s with his family and they are some of our favorite
          nights. She always feeds us so well and gives the best advice about life. Grandma also gave Kelli the Chinese name of “xiao-nian” meaning
          water lily, graceful yet grounded. In March of 2019, we are visiting more of Henry’s extended family in Chengdu, China with Henry’s sister
          Shelby. It is so exciting for the both of us that Kelli gets to experience where Henry grew up and visit the places he used to be a menacing
          little turd (ask him about the time he lit neighbor’s clothes on fire)
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone loves to ask when recently married couples are going to have kids. We’ll save you the suspense and tell you that we want try pretty
          soon after the wedding! We can’t wait to start a family of our own.

          ravel for us doesn’t just mean hopping on a plane, although we like to do that too. One of our favorite ways to travel is on Henry’s
          motorcycle. We have been on so many bike trips and it’s honestly the best way to connect with each other. On a bike there’s no distraction
          of the phone, or texting other people. It’s just the two of us, together on the road. There has been some amazing trips…like our 3 week trip
          throughout Italy on a Moto Guzzi with nothing more than one back pack each. We started in the rolling hills of Tuscany to witness Henry’s
          best friend Riley get married to the love of his life, Kenzie. Then explored the architecture of Florence, and history in Rome and ate our
          weight in seafood pasta and gnocchi. Riding along the Amalfi Coast was breathtaking and a once in a lifetime opportunity. It was there in
          Sorrento, Henry asked Kelli to “be his turd forever” (not joking, that’s what he said). If you haven’t peeped the video, check it out on the
          <router-link to="/proposal">proposal</router-link>
          page! Not all bike trips are rainbows and butterflies though. We once rode back to Seattle from Whistler in the summertime and got stuck in
          a torrential downpour on the freeway. Shivering, we rode to a small town before the US border to dry our clothes at a laundromat so we could
          make it the final 3 hours home. We both love the mountains and frequent the Washington ski resorts as well as Whistler. When we started
          dating, Kelli wasn’t a very good skier. She knew the basics but there was a lot of pizza/french fry action going on. From getting lost in
          the backcountry to spending 25 days skiing in one season, it has become one of our favorite winter time activities. Kelli thinks she’s
          pretty decent now and can mostly keep up with Henry. We now love taking trips with our ski buds to Colorado, Salt Lake City as well as our
          annual Whistler trip with 50+ of our rad friends. Nothing better than a full day on the mountain to earn that apres ski hot toddy!
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we can’t ski in the summertime, we love attending concerts and music festivals of all kinds. In our three years together have been to
          countless shows. The gorge is one of our happy places and favorite venues. Anyone down to start a petition to bring Sasquatch back?! One of
          the most memorable shows was when we were front row for Alabama Shakes at Sasquatch in 2016. Keeping that one in the memory bank. A close
          runner up to the Gorge is the Red Rocks in Denver. We stumbled across an old jam band called STS9 on a trip to Denver and have now been to
          two of their shows at Red Rocks now. It has become a new tradition of sorts. Mostly because it always aligns with the Broncos season opening
          game and Henry’s birthday. Another memorable festival was Coachella, because Henry was able to meet some of Kelli’s oldest friends for the
          first time. Despite the 110 degree weather it was such a fun week of music, dancing all night, and great friends. Also, Radiohead performed
          and it was a dream come true for Henry. Again, we could go on and on about all of the adventures we’ve had. But on a serious note, making
          memories with all you fools is the REASON we travel! And NO Flynn, they won’t be going to Electric Forest for our Honeymoon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cheers to all the mems we will get to experience with you in the future!
