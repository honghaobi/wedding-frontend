          et’s rewind back to Apple Cup November 29th, 2013 (Washington’s college football rivalry game). Kelli in crimson and Henry in a purple UW
          jersey and a backwards cap. They were introduced by their mutual bestfriend Brooke at a tailgating party, drinking Rainiers and playing
          cornhole. Henry was talking a lot of shit and forcing peeps taking shots. Aaaandddd the Cougars took a big L. Looking back, it’s a day to
          remember because that’s the day their friendship started despite the hatred of each other’s team.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the next 2 years their friendship grew stronger. They got to know each other over concerts, group events, and having deep conversations
          about life over tacos. They will both tell you that there was an unspoken connection between them, and they were always drawn towards
          eachother.

          Fast forward to Halloween of 2015. Henry came into the Kelli’s work because he "tweaked his back" and needed a massage. During the session,
          Henry asked her if she wanted to come over and he would make her steak dinner. Kelli was a little taken back and thought to herself "Is he
          asking me out on a date?!"
        </p>
        <p>
          He was.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that dinner date, they started hanging out almost every night. They had so much fun together, and it was starting to get serious. Both
          could see this being the real thing, the “One”, their person, *insert more corny phrases here*. Then the fairytale needed to take a pause.
          Henry had just got out of a long term relationship that summer and was a little hesitant to be off the market for good. Was he ready?
          Because he knew Kelli would be it. They had deep conversation and Kelli and Henry decided that if he wasn’t ready, then they did not want
          this to ruin their friendship that they both cherished.

          hat next month, Kelli was killin’ it on the dating app Bumble. She started seeing another guy (he was no Henry though). Henry and Kelli
          still talked as friends and after a number of weeks, Henry realized he made a mistake. How could he be such an idiot?! He asked Kell out for
          dinner to Din Tai Fung to talk about if they wanted to give it another shot and how he wanted to see this through, because he knew it was
          something special. Over a ginger martini and xiao long bao she told Henry that she had started dating someone else, but did still have
          feelings for him. What was a girl to do? She took a few weeks to think about it, but couldn’t get Henry off her mind. On December 28th, she
          told Henry that he was the one for her. FINALLY ON THE SAME PAGE! It wasn’t a hard choice for them when they decided to move in together…2
          months later. Some will say it’s too fast. They disagree. With learning how to live together early made their relationship stronger but not
          without some trials and tribulations (Henry is very OCD if you don’t know, and it took Kell a while to figure out how to execute the
          “proper” folding technique so towels fit perfectly in the closet…Don’t worry she’s a master at it now). But on the flip side Kelli has
          taught Henry how to let the same stuff go. This is just one example of how they balance each other out. They are Yin and Yang, opposites yet
          fit together. Together, they have always stood in unison on their beliefs, morals, values, and what is important in life. They continue to
          push and challenge eachother to be the best versions of themselves.
        </p>
        <p>

          In their three years together, they have been so blessed to have so many wonderful memories and experiences. They’d love to share them all
          but here are some favorite and most influential. If you’re still reading…scroll down!</p>

          enry & Kelli are both big family people, it’s the most important. So when the two decided to introduce each other to the families it was a
          big deal. Kelli took Hen to the super classy Emerald Queen Casino with her whole family. 80 bucks was lost in the slot machines but they got
          for dinner vouchers to the Tatoosh Grill. Ya win some ya lose some! It was there that Henry really got a chance to sit down and get to know
          everyone. Kell’s Dad, Mark started trash talking Henry’s NFL team the Bronco’s. The mini rivalry hasn’t stopped and the McKeown family lost
          a bet to Henry and they all had to begrudgingly wear Broncos jersey’s for a Hawks game. Henry has seamlessly fit into Kelli’s huge extended
          family. He recently cooked a 25-pound prime rib for Christmas dinner for her family to earn even more brownie points. Kelli met Henry’s
          family at his Grandma’s house and she learned about Kelli’s sweet tooth. Ever since, Grandma has never let Kell leave without sometime of
          chocolate and her famously delicious dumplings for leftovers. There are frequent dinners at Grandma’s with his family and some of their
          favorite nights. She always feeds them so well and gives the best advice about life. Soon after Henry and Kelli met, Grandma also gave her
          the Chinese name of “xiao-nian” meaning water lily, graceful yet grounded. In March of 2019, they are visiting more of Henry’s extended
          family in Chengdu, China with Henry’s sister Shelby. It is so exciting for the both of them that Kelli gets to experience where Henry grew
          up and visit the places he used to be a menacing little turd (Ask him about the time he lit neighbor’s cloths on fire)

          Everyone loves to ask when recently married couples are going to have kids. We’ll save you the suspense and tell you that we want try pretty
          soon after the wedding! We can’t wait to start a family of our own.
