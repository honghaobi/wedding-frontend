    <section>
      <div class="block">
        <h3 class="md-subheader">Why did you guys decide to do a destination wedding?</h3>
        <p>Good question! Weddings can be stressful. We wanted our day to be filled with fun events in the sun and less stress. And can you really
           trust Washington summer not to rain?! We also know that our friends and family work so hard all year long so it’s an opportunity to get out
           of town, and away from the real world. That way you can all let go, have fun, and not have to worry about going to work the next day.</p>

        <h3 class="md-subheader">When should we book our flights?</h3>
        <p>Download the hopper app to track flights. Although they do not partner with Alaska or Delta so you will have to check those flights
           separately. We will also be sending out updates via email if we find a cheap deal so you guys can jump on it!</p>

        <h3 class="md-subheader">After we land, how do we get to our resort?</h3>
        <p>Here is a shuttle service our wedding planner recommended to book through:
          <span class="md-accent">Impala Shuttles.</span>
           You can pre-pay online before the trip. This is the preferred method. You will go past baggage claim and through a foyer, turn right to
           exit the airport. The pre-paid shuttles will be waiting there. There will be a driver waiting with an Impala sign (or whatever shuttle
           service you decide). Check in with the driver so he can mark that you have arrived. When all guests have checked in he will start loading
           up the shuttle so stay close. After the baggage claim, in the foyer is an area of shuttle workers that will try to get you to get on one of
           their shuttles, just keep walking past them until you get outside. It can be a little overwhelming but don’t feel bad if you ignore
           them. </p>

        <h3 class="md-subheader">How do we get to the wedding Venue?</h3>
        <p>We will have set up Shuttles/buses to take guests to and from Acre. The shuttles will be leaving Garza Blanca. The time is still TBD, but
           we will provide you with a timeline of the weekend in your room when you arrive.</p>

        <h3 class="md-subheader">Can I bring my kids?</h3>
        <p>This is our biggest adulting moment yet and while we love your children, this is a grown-ups only wedding. If you must bring them,
           kids under 12 stay free at Garza, but unfortunately our venue discourages children. For this reason we are not allowing kids to the
           wedding ceremony and reception. We will be contacting our resort to try and set up some babysitting options, so if that is something you
           are interested
           in please contact us directly.</p>

        <h3 class="md-subheader">Can we bring a plus one?</h3>
        <p>Only names on the invite are allowed to the wedding. It’s nothing personal but we are limited by cost and number of guests. Thank you for
           understanding.</p>

        <h3 class="md-subheader">What is there to do in Cabo?</h3>
        <p>We will have some specific events set up for people if they want to join like, fishing, golfing, a night out in Cabo. But if you want to do
           things on your own that’s fine too! You can check out the shops downtown, go to the famous bars like Mango Deck and the Office, swim in the
           ocean, snorkel etc... Remember, this is your vacation!</p>

        <h3 class="md-subheader">Is there a specific wedding attire?</h3>
        <p>Vacation cocktail attire. Some examples are slacks and a nice short sleeve button up for guys. It will be hot so feel free to wear shorts
           (just no jorts, NEVER jorts). A summer cocktail dress for gals. (no flip flops please).</p>

        <h3 class="md-subheader">How does cell service work in Cabo?</h3>
        <p>If you have T-mobile, some plans include Mexico data and text in your plan without needing to sign up for anything. We have T-mobile and
           have never had issues. For other carriers, you may need to pay around $3-5 a day for data, text and call capabilities. We have found
           it’s worth it for at least one person in your party to have data for the map feature and calling taxis. You can also download WhatsApp for
           text capabilities while connected to wifi.</p>

        <h3 class="md-subheader">Who do I contact for questions when we are in Cabo?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Stephanie McKeown - Maid of Honor (253)380-9892</li>
          <li>Will Schumacher - Best Man (206)388-8795</li>
          <li>Jerri McKeown - Mother of the Bride (253)380-9802</li>
          <li>Jessica Wolff - Wedding Planner WhatsApp +52 1 624 157 2647</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="md-subheader">Should I choose all-inclusive or the European plan?</h3>
        <p>We suggest doing all-inclusive because it takes the stress out of bringing cash to pay for food and drinks at the resort. This is a nicer
           resort with better food so a dinner check will be around $60/per person. Alcoholic drinks run about $11/cocktail, $4/beer not including
           tips. So we feel the European plan may only be worth it if you are not planning to drink and don’t think you will be eating at the resort
           much. Otherwise food and drinks can add up really fast. For the all inclusive plan, you will get the best bang for your buck if you are
           eating most meals at the resort and planning on drinking.</p>

        <h3 class="md-subheader">I’m worried about if Cabo San Lucas is safe to travel?</h3>
        <p>Bad things happen in every city, and it doesn’t mean they are not safe. Mexico did have an increase violence in 2017. But since the Mexican
           government has spent $50 billion dollars to improve safety. In 2018 violence was down by 70%. But to be extra safe, stay in the tourist
           areas and don’t act a fool. Also, read this article below.
          <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestravelguide/2018/08/31/is-it-safe-to-travel-to-los-cabos/#41314f25206a" target="_blank">
            Safe to Travel to Cabo?</a>
        </p>

        <h3 class="md-subheader">Do I need to learn Spanish?</h3>
        <p>Most locals in tourist areas know English. But it wouldn’t hurt to brush up on some phrases so you can order that tequila shot like a pro.
           You can learn with the free app Duolingo, or download Google Translate for in the moment translations.</p>

        <h3 class="md-subheader">Should we rent a car?</h3>
        <p>If you are feeling adventurous and want to explore what Cabo has to offer, renting a car would be the way to go! You can book a car for as
           little as $3/day. But we suggest also purchasing insurance when booking your car. Some car insurances will extend your insurance
           into Mexico so it might be worth it to check with your company first! We have personally never rented a car while there because you can
           always take a taxi or book shuttle into town if you have a group.</p>

        <h3 class="md-subheader">What is the exchange rate and should I bring pesos?</h3>
        <p>As of 01/01/19 the exchange rate was $19.92 MXN pesos to $1 USD. The rate is subject to change daily so make sure you
           check back. You will get the best rate if you get pesos from your bank but make sure you order them at least a week before your departure
           date. The booths at the airport will charge you a fee. Most places accept debit and credit cards if you are looking to buy anything while
           you are down there. If you want to tip, you should bring some pesos but they will also accept dollars if you are in a pinch. If you are
           doing all-inclusive you really don’t need any pesos, unless you get a taxi or want to buy drinks when we go out in Cabo.</p>

        <h3 class="md-subheader">When should I request my passport?</h3>
        <p>Passport processing takes between 6 to 8 weeks, however, if you choose an expedited service, you can receive a faster
           processing time. There is a $60 fee to expedite. Sooner than later is always better.</p>

        <h3 class="md-subheader">What are the plans leading up to the wedding day?</h3>
        <p>The only event we would love for you to attend is the welcome meet and greet with drinks, cocktails and snacks. This will be
           on Thursday night at Garza Blanca, time is TBD. Otherwise, feel free to make this your vacation and do what you want.</p>

        <h3 class="md-subheader">Where is the ceremony/reception taking place?</h3>
        <p>The wedding is at a beautiful outdoor event space called ACRE, a 25 acre piece of farmland adjacent to San Jose del Cabo and located 25
           minutes from Garza Blanca. We will be providing transportation to and from the wedding.</p>
