    <h1>Book Your Airport Shuttles to Garza Blanca Resort</h1>
    <h2 class="header"><a href="http://impalacabo.net/" target="_blank">With Impala Cabo Transportation Service</a></h2>
    <p> If you have not booked transportation from the airport to Garza Blanca you can book with Impala Cabo. It is a trusted transportation company
        that was recommended by our wedding planner Jessica. We are using this company to transport everyone to and from the wedding venue, and other
        events as well. You can select to do either private or shared shuttle and depending on the number of people in your group the price changes.
    </p>

    <h3>Below are instructions to how to make a booking online, their website is not very user friendly, so bear with us.</h3>
